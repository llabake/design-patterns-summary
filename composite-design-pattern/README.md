### Composite Design Pattern
According to wikipedia, The composite pattern describes a group of objects that is treated the same way as a single instance of the same type of object.

##### The Intent
> Compose objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. Composite lets clients treat individual objects and compositions of object uniformly.

##### The Problem it tries to solve
- A part-whole hierarchy should be represented so that clients can treat part and whole objects uniformly.
- A part-whole hierarchy should be represented as tree structure.

##### The solution
- Come up with a way to manipulate the primitive and composite objects uniformly
- 

##### Example code in ruby
